This is a very simple Arduino program that sings the Game of Thrones theme song with a buzzer and LEDs.

I will try to include a better circuit diagram, but for now:
* Connect the negative of the buzzer to ground and the positive of the buzzer to pin A0.
* Connect the shorter legs of the LEDs to ground, via a 330 ohmns resistor.
* Connect the longer legs of the LEDs to pins 9, 10, 11.

Hopefully the videos will make the circuit arrangement clearer.
